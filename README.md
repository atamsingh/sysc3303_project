# SYSC 3303 Project Group 11
- This is actually an esclipse project. To use this project easily, choose the GX11_ITXX folder as Eclipse workspace.
- The program actually lives in the project folder and the tests for all of those classes exists in test folder.
- Some sample functions have been created in the program classe. Example for client test is also created. please follow similar programming styling
- Any funciton you feel will be useful for more than 1 class, please create it in the Commons class so we can share this funcitonlity. Some funcitons live there now. Feel free to add more or remove some. e,g, I can see the confirming acknowledge function being something common. 
- Please make a branch for yourself on the repo. and PRs for all of us to look at the work progress. Commit often offcourse. Would hate to loose work that's been done. 
- For the project folder name, I choose ITXX since this can be our working model over different iterations.
